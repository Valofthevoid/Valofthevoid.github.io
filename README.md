Original Project by Syrtica and can be found here: https://github.com/Syrtica/KIM-Extra.

I got the itch to write some fic for warframe based around the hex and i thought it would be cool to use the hex system. Stumbled across Syrtica's project, but it wasn't set up like the KIM system in game so i thought id give it a crack and bring it to that aesthetic.

I am not a coder by any means. I had one web dev class in college and thats about the limit of my experience, so the code will more than likely look like absolute spaghetti, sorry. I'm basically slapping what little i know together and lots of googling to get where i want. So take it easy on me please qwq, i just wanted a system to write my fanfic in that looked like the system in game >w>.

I am also not a fanfic writer, this would be my first go at it, so the quality is going to be horrendous, but its my trash mom.

## What browsers are supported?
Like Syrtica, No idea.

## Why do this?
I thought itd be fun. And it is. A little sanity draining but fun. My fics itself will not be good, but id at least have the cool system set up, so thats something.

## Can you do XYZ?!
uhh.... probably not.
