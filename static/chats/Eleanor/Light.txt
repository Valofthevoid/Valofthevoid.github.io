I'd never thought much about the lights until recently.

Drifter: [
What lights? >2
]

#2

All of them. Streetlights, searchlights, myriad ceiling lights and sconces and lamps in every little home.
And then a Scaldra APC smashes itself into a substation and a chunk of the city goes dark.

Drifter: [
Is that hypothetical? >4
Does that happen a lot? >3
]

#4

I'm sure they've done it at least once, but in this case, yes. >5

#3

Gods, no. But part of me wishes it did.
Can you imagine? >5

#5

I can't remember the last time I saw a truly starry sky, and it's all those lights doing it.

Drifter: [
And the fires... >6
I didn't even think about it. >8
At least there's Transference, I guess? >33
]

#6

Oh, shush. Let me be salty about light pollution without reminding me of little inconveniences like "air quality" and "weather."

Drifter: [
Clouds ruin it, too. >7
Sorry. I see the stars all the time, so I didn't think about what it might mean to you. >8
]

#7

Much like you ruin wistful moods. >E

#8

That's because you're privileged. Almost insufferably so.
Not only do you see the stars, you see them how they're meant to be seen.
No meddlesome skyglow. No murky particulate. Not even an atmosphere.
Only your eyes and a pane of layered glass. Or whatever material your windows are made of.

Drifter: [
There's always Transference. I can bring you up there, whenever you want to look. >32
]

#33

Not quite what I'm after, I'm afraid. I do appreciate your kindness. Truly. >9

#32

Thank you. I do appreciate the offer. Truly. >9

#9

But when you're "driving" me, I can't choose where to look. I can't let my eyes wander on their own to whichever unfathomably distant candle catches their fancy.
I suppose I enjoy stargazing the same way most people like to watch fireflies. Your attention naturally shifts as they float about.
Stars are much less stressful. They don't need to worry about little trifles like eating and breeding and staying out of the rain. Stars are effortless.

Drifter: [
    Fireflies are bugs? >13
    Sounds like you want to look at the stars alone. >14
    The stars you can see from the roof aren't good enough? >34
]

#34

Have you been up there?
&ArthurDating I suppose you must have been.
No, they aren't. They're little muddied pinpricks. No colour. Unidentifiable constellations.
If ancient humans tried to navigate by what they saw up there, they'd have found another bloody way to do it. >17

#13

Oh no, Drifter, you really are missing out. I'll find a video for you.
I won't watch it with you, though. Best done by your lonesome, at least the first time.
That's the other rub with Transference, by the way. You're always there. &EleanorDating>16:15

#14

Yes. Exactly. &EleanorDating>16:15

#15

Not that I don't like you, of course. I adore you. It's only that there's something precious in being alone that Transference doesn't allow me to experience. >17

#16

Not that I don't like you, of course. I love you. But there's no one on this planet I could spend every waking moment with and not go at least a little bit mad. >17

#17

Drifter: [
    So what's the answer? >10
]

#10

To what?

Drifter: You getting to stargaze. >11

#11

There isn't one.

Drifter: Nothing? Like, at all? >12

#12

Nothing at all.
Not all problems are solvable, Drifter. The world doesn't work that way.

Drifter: [
    You're forgetting the time loop. >18
    I don't know *how* the world works at this point. Do you? >19
]

#19

No one ever does. Some people think they do, but they're generally naive or delusional.
That doesn't mean we can't notice patterns, work out the meaning of one little cog here and there. >20

#18

I don't think I am, actually. Some problems aren't solvable, even in a time loop. >20

#20

That's not to say I'd ignore a solution if you found one.
It also doesn't mean I'll stop looking.
But, for the moment, no. It isn't solvable, much as I would love for it to be.

Drifter: [
    You could leave the city. >21
    Make a spaceship? >22
    Shut off all the lights? >23
]

#23

Are we brainstorming now? Far be it from me to argue, I suppose.
I'll forgive you for not having an inherent familiarity with the technology here, but there are things reliant on electricity far beyond the average lightbulb.
Medical equipment, for example.
Before you say it, yes, I know everyone will reset. That doesn't mean I could forgive myself if I killed vulnerable people for my own selfish desires.

Drifter: [
    So we go for the lightbulbs. >28
    So we convince people to turn the lights off voluntarily. >29
]

#28

The lightbulbs? I can't imagine how you think these things work, but you can't blow out the bulbs and do no damage to the rest of it.
Even if we got all the streetlamps and spotlights, we're not home invaders.
We might get the residents to turn off the lights on their own, though. >35

#29

That... isn't quite as far-fetched an idea as I'd expected. >35

#35

It could be framed as necessity — the preservation of a limited resource. A staged collaborative effort, seeking outside aid and investment.
Or just a trashy public holiday, where drunk people stumble around, shut off all their lights at once, and go to bed early.
Somehow, tricking people doesn't sour me as badly as getting them killed.
The cherry on top is the feeling that I'd be turning my journalistic prowess in rebellion against my younger self.
I don't know how realistic it is, but I like this one. >36

#22

Are we brainstorming now? Far be it from me to argue, I suppose.
I doubt we have the materials. I know for certain that we don't have the knowledge.
If we screw it up, and something breaks up in the atmosphere, will it spread techrot far and wide?
Before you say it, yes, I know everyone will reset. That doesn't mean I could forgive myself if I did infect them all through carelessness.

Drifter: [
    So we find a way to stop it from spreading. >24
    So we make sure we don't screw it up. >27
]

#27

You're a beautiful optimist, Drifter, and I admire that about you.
How, pray tell, would we find the expertise to build a rocket?
Moreover, how would we build it in under a year?

Drifter: [
    We can find an expert. On the internet, maybe? >25
    We can learn. It's eternity, right? >30
]

#30

"Do you know how long that would take?!" I'd like to yell, incredulously.
But the eternal loop of a single year doesn't leave much room to complain, does it? >26

#21

Are we brainstorming now? Far be it from me to argue, I suppose.
I can't leave. The Hex and transformation aside, I would infect thousands of innocent people if I broke quarantine.
Before you say it, yes, I know they'll reset. That doesn't mean I could forgive myself if I did it deliberately.

Drifter: So we find a way to stop it from spreading. >24

#24

Do you have an immunologist in your back pocket? An expert in techrot? No?

Drifter: [
    No. But we can find one. >25
    We don't need that. One of us can learn. >30
]

#25

And what if we do? That person will forget again with new year, same as everyone else.
Though I suppose we'd know how to find them at that point. Their notes and things would be reset too, I suppose.
Possible epiphany — and please let me down easy if it isn't —
Those belongings of yours that come and go with you, they aren't subject to all this "resetting," are they?
Hmm. >26

#26

Drifter: Can we at least say it's worth thinking about? >31

#36

Drifter: So we can agree it's worth thinking about? >31

#31

Yes.
I might — and I emphasize "might" — be a little hopeful about meditating under the unfiltered stars someday.
Long term goals, Eleanor. Long term goals. >E
