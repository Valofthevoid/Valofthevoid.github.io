I FORGOT
i dunno why i didn't ask about the internet before and whether you even have one
cause i mean you kind of get it but when you don't you reeeaaaaaally don't lol

Drifter: [
    We have internet, but it's not like yours. >6
    Nope. The internet is dead. >2
    &!DrifterInBackroom I'm in space right now, and I'm talking to you over the internet. Does that count? >17
    Busy, gtg. >E
]

#17

oml WHAT
did i know about this?!
wait does time pass the same when you're up there
is it supposed to do that

Drifter: [
    I guess? >24
    Entrati designed it, so... >20
    ...I think that question gave me a headache... >18
]

#24

Drifter: I mean, there's nothing around to cause severe time dilation. If I'm moving a little slower, or a little faster, you wouldn't notice. >25

#25

&AmirSpaceScience=TRUE

whoooooooooosh
see that's the sound of what you just said zooming way past me because i've never had to look up FRIGGING SPACE before
brb gotta go research time dilation >E

#20

so, yes
aaaaaaaaghrhasdljawpk i don't want to think about him right now gonna go run it off >E

#18

yeah me too lmao
we'll just pretend i didn't think about it
we did not talk i was never here :x &AmirDating>19:E

#19

wedidiwastotallyherecomeseemewhenyou'rehomeimissyou >E

#2

whaaaaat?? HOW DO YOU TALK TO PEOPLE?!
like you still have to talk to people right? like if you want to get a gun dropshipped DIRECTLY TO YOUR SPACESHIP you have to have something
i mean unless there's a different way to talk but how would you do that without a network
you don't use carrier pigeons in space lol can you imagine
like don't get me wrong i'd die happy if i had a pet pigeon that i didn't have to feed or remember to take care of or anything because it could SURVIVE IN SPACE
but there's no way that's a thing
that's not a thing right?

Drifter: [
    Stay on topic lol. Internet. >3
    Sorry, no pet superpigeons. >14
]

#14

pffff someone needs to get on that asap lol >13

#3

INTERNET YES
okaysorrybutlike
you have to
i know you're telling me you DON'T have it but since I KNOW you don't have sir or madam badass superpigeon there's gotta be some kind of infrastructure
wait hold on it's just radio isn't it
noooooo it's just radio isn't it?!
that is so boring
and SLOW

Drifter: [
It's not that bad. We use the Void to shorten transit on important transmissions. >7
I don't think it's boring. It's like fire. >21
]

#21

you mean actual fire and not fire like 'woah i'm impressed radio's so cool' fire right?
&AmirDating lol ok ok lay it on me loveadoodle, why fire >22
&!AmirDating lol ok ok lay it on me, why fire >22

#22

Drifter: Humankind figured out fire really early, right? And you still use it. You figured out *better ways* to use it, but it's still here. >23

#23

&AmirRadioScience=TRUE

ooooohhhhh got it got it, radio waves are just SO GOOD that they stick around
yeah i can see that
and in the future it's probably something people can put together in two seconds with like, scraps from the back yard lmao
right now it's like COMPANY RELEASES NEW SLEEK RADIO TRANSMITTER or SPACE AGENCY ADDS NEW RADIO SATELLITE
but for you it's probably like LITTLE BILLY BUILT TRANSMITTER PENCIL TO TALK TO HIS FRIEND WHO MOVED TO PLUTO
ok yeah that's pretty cool actually
and hey i've got all the time in the world to learn how to make my own awesome backyard mad science, so
brb just had a funny idea >E

#7

still boring >13

#13

&AmirPigeonScience=TRUE

&AmirDating badass superpigeon idea just landed in my brain tho talk later <3 <3 <3 >E
badass superpigeon idea just landed in my brain tho talk later >E

#6

Drifter: [
There are systems that talk to each other, but people don't use it. >11
If I send a message, it takes a while to get there. Something like KIM wouldn't work. >8
]

#11

why tho?!
like i get that messages take a long time but >5

#8

okay but kim isn't the whole internet >5

#5

what about message boards or websites
or email >12

#12

Drifter: [
We kind of have email? I get messages sometimes. >26
Maybe because of spam? >9
I don't know why we don't have those. We just don't. >52
]

#52

maybe they do exist and you just don't have access
like if everyone's divided into their little cliques and they all run stuff for just THEM
and they're like 'nah drifter's not invited to this party'

Drifter: [
    Ouch. >54
    I've never even heard of them though. >53
]

#54

oml no wait hold on i didn't mean that you're an outcast or anything
i mean you do have your social 'moments' but that's just your upbringing it's fine
wait no i didn't mean that either
&AmirDating pleasedon'tbreakupwithme

Drifter: [
    It's okay, lol. I know it's just hypothetical. >57
    You're not completely wrong, though. >58
]

#57

ohthanksol >56

#58

Drifter: There are definitely people who stay close to me because of what I can do, not for who I am as a person. >55

#55

yeah i know that feeling
and it makes you doubt the people who ARE around for the right reasons &!AmirDating>56
i don't doubt you but i definitely doubt most people >56

#56

i'm gonna go before i put my foot in my mouth again
&AmirDating thanks for the info babe :D >E
thanks for the info friendo :D >E

#53

that's kinda depressing
i mean
yeah, people can be HORRIBLE sometimes in places but it's pretty okay if the admins stay on the ball
and it's nice getting to know people where i can write a post out and not have to worry about how long it takes or whether it makes sense because i can just rewrite it until it does
so
yeah
gotta think about that but thanks for the info
you're the bessssssttttt >E

#26

&AmirDating hun
i hate to break it to you but you can't just say 'i get messages sometimes' and not elaborate on that
i mean that's just email right lol

Drifter: [
    It's mostly receipts. >27
    It's mostly advertisements. >39
    It's mostly free stuff. >47
    It's mostly hate mail... >50
]

#50

lol good one

Drifter: I'm not joking. >59

#59

seriously?! your inbox is straight up full of hate mail?!
WHAT DID YOU DO LMAO

Drifter: [
    I killed people. >51
    I killed some VIPs. >51
    I killed people, robots, infested... >51
]

#51

...oh
i gtg >E

#47

what's the catch?

Drifter: Catch? >60

#60

yeah like 'you get this free stuff if you sign up for a year of our crappy cds' or 'here's a free game but it came with a trojan lol enjoy'

Drifter: [
    There's no catch. It's just free stuff. >49
    I guess the catch is that I had to earn it? >48
]

#48

PHEW OK THE FUTURE DOESN'T HAVE FREE STUFF
CRISIS AVERTED
i'm kidding i know you just mean it didn't cost you any money or anything >49

#49

free stuff exists here SOMETIMES but having an inbox FULL OF FREE STUFF is like
aaaaaghhhh i'm jealous
gonna go find something free to give someone so i feel better about the present
GET IT THE PRESENT HA HA
yeah that wasn't funny but the doing part wasn't a joke so brb >E

#39

uuuuugh SPAM >67

#67

i HATE spam
you sign up for something cool ONE TIME and suddenly you get emails from like a billion scuzzy sites
and then if they do it too much i have to do something about it to make them stop
like ask
or get their info and find an exploit
or spin up a server and keep HITTING THEM WITH REQUESTS until it can't send anything anymore
mostly i just ask

Drifter: [
    Sounds... vindictive? >40
    I kinda like the advertisements I get. It's always good stuff. >46
]

#46

add one to the column of things better in the future
out here in shitty past land a guy can only get offered 'enlargement' so many times before he wants to scream

Drifter: [
    &AmirDating &Sexy I get it. No one wants to see ads for something they don't need. ;) >43
    Enlargement? &AmirDating>42:41
]

#40

yeah ok but a guy can only get offered 'enlargement' so many times before he wants to scream okay

Drifter: [
