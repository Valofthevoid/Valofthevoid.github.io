We're running low on gun oil.
Amir's set to pilfer it from Viktor's crew in the next few days.
I've left some motor oil with the cleaning supplies to tide us over.
Use it only if you have to.

Drifter: [
I'm reading that as "Use more space lasers today, Drifter." &ArthurDating>2:3
Motor oil? Is that safe? >5
I have my own supply. >19
Got it, thanks. >E

#2

I would've used a term of endearment, sweets, but that's close enough. >33

#3

Heh. Exactly right.
If you want targets for those "space lasers," grab something off the board.
There's a miserable backlog. >E

#19

Are you offering?

Drifter: [
    Yeah, of course. &ArthurDating>20:21
    LOL. >23
]

#23

Should've known. >E

#20

I could kiss you right now. >22

#21

You're spoiling us, mate. >22

#22

Drop it by when you can. I'll let the others know. >E

#4

Right. This is what I get for trying to be nice.
I'll leave you off next time. >E

#5

Not exactly "manufacturer recommended," but it does well enough in a pinch.

Drifter: [
    I can't imagine what situation made you even think of trying that. >18
    Good info. Thanks. >E

#18

Not my idea. Picked it up from a commander my first year in.
Might've been the only *useful* thing he ever tried to teach us.

Drifter: He had a lot of not-useful info? >6

#6

He was an encyclopaedia of stupid trivia. King of his hometown pub quiz, he said.
Cruel. Full of himself. Never once took blame if he could shunt it off to someone else.

Drifter: [
    So, the opposite of you. &ArthurDating>7:13
    Bet you hated his guts. >25
]

#25

For the most part.
He was everything I didn't want to be.

Drifter: [
Based on how you're describing the guy? I'd say you won that one. &ArthurDating>7:13
&!ArthurSelfCritic You're too self-critical to ever be full of it. &ArthurDating>10:14
At least you don't have to deal with him anymore. >17

#7

You always see the best in me. &ArthurSelfCritic>33:30

#30

Drifter: You don't, so I have to. >8

#8

There's... a lot I could say to that. >16

#9

Grab a bounty off the board if you need to take it out on something. >E

#10

Drifter: And I mean that in the most affectionate way possible. >11

#11

I'd argue that, but it'll have to be some other time. >12

#12

&ArthurSelfCritic=TRUE

Today being the minor shitshow that it is.

Drifter: [
That's fine, I get it. We'll talk later. &ArthurDating>31:27
Sounds like an excuse. >9

#31

Thanks, love. And, one more thing, before I'm back to work —
No matter how long today's "shitshow" drags on, I won't miss our dinner date.
Viktor will have to do a lot worse to deny me *that.* >E

#33

One more thing, before I'm back to work — we're up to our ears in it, today.
...To the point that the duty rota's more of a "suggestion" than a proper schedule...
&Sexy I might need a rain check on our... extracurriculars.
But I won't miss our dinner date. >E

#24

I'll be getting back to work. Sodding shitshow today, courtesy of our friend Viktor. >27

#27

If you're free, grab something off the board.
There's a miserable backlog. >E

#13

I'd like to think so. Bloody low bar for me to clear, though. >24

#14

Drifter: [
    And I'm not trying to insult you. It's just true. >11
    Seriously. You need to chill out sometimes. >15
]

#15

Well, this sounds like an old powderkeg.
Look, mate. I've no issue digging in on that. >16

#16

But I'll have to defer. >12

#17

Hah. Very true. &ArthurDating>33:24
