Why didn't I know that you play komi?

Drifter: [
I guess it never came up. >5
I don't actually like it. >3
I wish I wasn't so bad at it. >2
]

#3

Got it.
Forget I brought it up, then. >E

#2

I might be able to help with that. >5

#5

Would you be willing to play a round or two?
I'm sure I can scrounge up a board.

Drifter: [
Sure, I'm in. >6
I guess? >7
I'm up for it, but it'll be my first time playing against an actual person. >8
Not really interested, sorry. >3
]

#7

It's all right if you aren't interested.

Drifter: [
No, I'm interested. >6
It's just that I've never played against a person. >8
Yeah, I'll pass. Sorry. >3
]

#6

All right. >11

#8

I'm going to assume Duviri was involved in that.

Drifter: [
Yeah. Duviri. >9
Yeah, but... the other komi player in Duviri isn't *human*. >32
]

#32

Drifter: [
She's a rablit. >12
She's a rodent. >10
]

#9

Well, I'll gladly be the first "real" person you play against. >11

#10

A rodent? Like one of Lettie's rats?

Drifter: [
Yeah, kind of. She's a "rablit." >12
Bigger than Lettie's rats. >13
]

#12

Duviri has rabbits?

Drifter: [
Rablits. With an L. >33
What's a rabbit? >33
Is that a typo? >33
]

#33

Long ears? Hop around as much as they walk?

Drifter: [
Antlers? >34
Razor-sharp claws? >34
I can pretty much *guarantee* that rablits are weirder than whatever you're thinking of. >15

#34

&ArthurKomiRabbit=TRUE

... >14

#15

Drifter: [
They look like a gigantic rat skeleton hatched inside a boiled playground ball. >18
Your "holiday dinner" is the one where you shave a bird and cook it with the skeleton still inside, right? >37
Imagine, um... Viktor, I guess? Imagine he got into art instead of... complaining. >38
]

#37

Drifter: Imagine one of those. Except the leftovers get up and kind of... hop around. >16

#38

Drifter: Say he finds a rat skeleton, coats it with ferrocite, and adds horns. >39

#39

Drifter: And then a meat-blob of techrot drops from the ceiling, lands on its back, and kind of... grabs the bones. >40

#40

Drifter: Some floppy flesh-ears grow on its head. Now it's "alive." >17

#18

&ArthurKomiRabbit=TRUE

Drifter: Oh, but Teshin's rablit — the one I play komi with — she's blue. And she found... or grew... a face. Somehow. >14

#16

&ArthurKomiRoast=TRUE

Drifter: ...You still there? >35

#35

Yes. Sol help me, that is the hardest I've laughed all week.
First things first: we don't "shave" the bird.
&ArthurDating Although it's adorable that you thought that's the way it worked.

Drifter: [
Yeah, yeah. Laugh it up. >26
I've seen pictures. I *know* the feathers come off. &ArthurDating>27:28
In my defense, birds in Duviri don't have skin. >29
]

#27

They're plucked, sweets, not shaved. >29

#28

They're plucked, mate, not shaved. >29

#29

Next time I see a feather laying around, I'll pick it up for you. You'll get it then.
But — shaved or not — >31

#26

Trust me. I am. >31

#31

Half-eaten roast stands up and walks out in the middle of dessert?
Sol. I can imagine the looks on my parents' faces. And the quiet. &ArthurParents>30:42

#42

Pair it with a bottle and I might actually *enjoy* bloody Solstice.

Drifter: [
You don't really talk about your parents. >20
Solstice was that bad? >21
]

#30

I'll let you know when I find a komi set, all right?
Hopefully I play the game a bit better than the Solstice roast. >E

#20

We don't have much of a relationship. Pleasantries only. >22

#21

Put it this way.
If I had to choose between fighting techrot at Solstice or spending it with my parents, I'd choose the techrot.
And it isn't close. >22

#22

Drifter: I didn't know you were on such bad terms. >41

#41

We aren't.
That's what makes it all such a sodding headache. &ArthurDating>23:24

#23

Look, love. I'm not dodging. Promise. >25

#24

Look, mate. No offense. >25

#25

&ArthurParents=TRUE

But I'd really rather talk about this another time.
I'll let you know when I've found a komi set, all right? >E

#17

&ArthurKomiViktor=TRUE

Bloody hell.
I have absolutely no idea how Viktor, of all people, plays in, but...
You've given me a surprisingly *decent* mental image.
Although I can't say I'd ever be able to explain it to anyone else.
At any rate, here's hoping I play a better game of komi than... that. >11

#13

&ArthurKomiRodent=TRUE

I can't believe I'm asking this...
Was the rodent any good at it?

Drifter: [
No. >14
Better than me. >14
]

#14

Without fail, whenever I begin to think I've understood Duviri...

Drifter: You should really give up on that. >36

#36

Curse my optimism, I suppose. >11

#11

I'll let you know when I've found a set. >E
