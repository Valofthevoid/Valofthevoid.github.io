And now she's playing keepaway with what looks like a lump of flesh. >3

I can't get it away from her. She's doing that bloody void thing, and she's never listened to a word I say. &ArthurDating>4:11

Eleanor's refusing to help. "Too funny," far as she's concerned.

So, Drifter. >5

But she likes *you*.
So, Drifter.
Sweets.
Love of my life. >5

Please come and catch this godsforsaken cat before I lose my sanity.
