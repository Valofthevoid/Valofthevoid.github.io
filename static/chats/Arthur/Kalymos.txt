Drifter: Have you seen Kalymos? >2

#22

Drifter: I couldn't find Kalymos before I left. Have you seen her? >2

#2

Not recently.
I assume she's set out to skulk around someplace.
If she jumps on my face while I'm asleep again, I swear to Sol…

Drifter: [
    Aw, come on. You like that she pays attention to you. >4
    &Sexy I mean, I got to kiss it better, so... >10
    &Sexy She was pretty playful after that, though. I think she just likes you. >3
    &!Sexy It's probably because she likes you. >3
    Here's a fun thought: maybe she did the same thing to Albrecht. >9

Well...
You don't need an excuse for that. &!DrifterInBackroom>5

Drifter: [
    It's not really an "excuse" when it's something I'm gonna do anyway... >5
    What can I say? I like variety. >5
    Sure, I know. Wanna come help me with something real quick? >11

I hope you're not about to ask me to help find the bloody cat.

Drifter: [
    ...No. Not the cat. >12
    Can you blame me for trying? >5

#12

All right... What do you need help with?

Drifter: [
    ... >13
    Things. The kind of things I'm making up excuses for. Right now. >13

Oh.
Right.
Love, I'm on duty.

Drifter: [
    Well, I tried. >14
    A half hour break won't make the mall explode. >15
    I'm just asking for a one-on-one morale boost. >16
    Please? >17

#15

I know it wouldn't.

Drifter: So how's it different from a really long bathroom break? >20

#16

Hah. I like that, actually.

Drifter: So let's use it. >20

#17

Sorry.
But it's flattering to know you couldn't resist. >18

#20

Sol, you're persistent.
And... impossible to turn down.
I'll be over in a minute. >E

It's flattering to know you couldn't resist. >18

And, this evening... we can take our time.
I don't think you need to worry about Kalymos, by the way.
Sounds like Lettie's shooing her out from upstairs. >E

#8

I'm all right. Not even a bruise.
Which makes me think it was deliberate aim, on her part. >5

#9

I sodding hope so. >5

#7

Thanks for the support, mate. >5

#3

I doubt that. >5

#4

She could pick a better bloody way to do it. >5

Oh for the love of —

You wanted to know where Kalymos was, right?
Best get out here. I think she's in the ceiling. >E

#26

Kalymos.
She's in the bloody ceiling. >E
